My color schemes also follow a set of guidelines for styling and stuff. Thing 
is not all colors in pallete can be used randomly, they are picked for specefic
purpose.
So I decided to name my colors differently to tell what is their purpose, something
like base16, I mean it is pretty useless, but IDC. It is to tell how and where
these colors are going to be used. ( inspired after base16 but there can be as
many colors as possible and the color usage depends on the color scheme instead of
global styling etc etc) 

The following order is followed:
# Main/Primary
* bg0_m : The main bg color 
* fg0_m : the main fg color
# Secondary
* fg1_dark : The darker fg color used on status bars, status line, line numbers. 
This is dependent on the color scheme whether to use fg1_dark or fg1, it really
depends on the pallete.
* fg1 : same thing as fg1_dark but lighter than fg0_m
* fg2 : the fg color used for selection (like base16) (this should contrast
fg1 and accent_m at the same time otherwise, it ain't orbium color scheme)
* fg3 : comments, invisibles, line highlighting
* fg4 : this is not going to be everywhere, and it doesn't have a definite purpose
either, it depends on the color scheme. This is the lightest fg

* bg1 : used for stuff like secondary UI elements, either sidebars, the status lines
the status bars, etc.
* bg2 : selection (if possible, this should have opacity of 0.75 (OPTIONAL), it doesn't 
do much difference but is definitely easier to read on translucent bg)
* bg3: the lightest bg, can be used in prompts and stuff like that.

# Accents
> [!NOTE]
> It is highly dependent on the scheme that how many accents it should have
> while this is weird and not all colors may be able to fit, that is why
> the standard is 6 accents, with bright versions, that's 12.
> on topic of what is their usage, it has not been decided yet
> nor what hue they should have is decided, although you it will probably
> be 0 degrees from accent_1 to 360 degrees to accent_6l as the standard
> I'l see what i decide on

Orbium: The Coquelicot's Grace
===
A very warmm and groovey with punchy contrast color scheme/pallete. 
It is inspired from the colors of sunset which is why it features the
warm and soothing coquelicot color as the main accent color. But ofcourse
you can use any accent color as the main color, go on with the summer groove!!


you can use any accent color as the main accent color.
