My color schemes also follow a set of guidelines for styling and stuff. Thing 
is not all colors in pallete can be used randomly, they are picked for specefic
purpose.
So I decided to name my colors differently to tell what is their purpose, something
like base16, I mean it is pretty useless, but IDC. It is to tell how and where
these colors are going to be used. ( inspired after base16 but there can be as
many colors as possible and the color usage depends on the color scheme instead of
global styling etc etc) 

The following order is followed:
<h3 align = "center"> Main/Primary </h3>

* bg0_m : The main bg color 
* fg0_m : the main fg color
<h3 align = "center"> Secondary </h3>

* fg1_dark : The darker fg color used on status bars, status line, line numbers. 
This is dependent on the color scheme whether to use fg1_dark or fg1, it really
depends on the pallete.
* fg1 : same thing as fg1_dark but lighter than fg0_m
* fg2 : the fg color used for selection (like base16) (this should contrast
fg1 and accent_m at the same time otherwise, it ain't orbium color scheme)
* fg3 : comments, invisibles, line highlighting
* fg4 : this is not going to be everywhere, and it doesn't have a definite purpose
either, it depends on the color scheme. This is the lightest fg

* bg1 : used for stuff like secondary UI elements, either sidebars, the status lines
the status bars, etc.
* bg2 : selection (if possible, this should have opacity of 0.75 (OPTIONAL), it doesn't 
do much difference but is definitely easier to read on translucent bg)
* bg3: the lightest bg, can be used in prompts and stuff like that.

<h3 align = "center"> Accents </h3>

> [!NOTE]
> It is highly dependent on the scheme that how many accents it should have
> while this is weird and not all colors may be able to fit, that is why
> the standard is 6 accents, with bright versions, that's 12.
> main accent color can either exist as a seperate color
> or any of the following can be the main accent color it isn't necassary for
> color scheme to have main accent either but mostly all in the Orb* family
> have a warm color as their main accent color


accent_m   : main accent color<br>
accent_1   : accent color nearest to 0 degrees in the color wheel or 360 degrees (red in hooman langauge)<br>
accent_1l  : accent color with same hue as accent_1 with hue and/or sat changes<br>
accent_2   : accent color nearest to 20-40 degrees in color wheel (orange in hooman language)<br>
accent_2l  : sat. or val. changed from accent_2<br>
accent_3   : accent color nearest to 40-80 degrees in color wheel (yellow in hooman language)<br>
accent_3l  : sat. or val. changed from accent_3<br>
accent_4   : accent color nearest to 80-160 degrees in color wheel (green in hooman language)<br>
accent_4l  : sat. or val. changed from accent_4
accent_4   : accent color FROM EXACTLY 180 degrees onward to 260 degrees<br>

Orbium: The Coquelicot's Grace
===
A very warmm and groovey with punchy contrast color scheme/pallete. 
It is inspired from the colors of sunset which is why it features the
warm and soothing coquelicot color as the main accent color. But ofcourse
you can use any accent color as the main color, go on with the summer groove!!
